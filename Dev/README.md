## Introduction

This task is a simple practice task so that you can make sure your environment is setup correctly, and compatible with DevSkiller.

During your programming tasks, you have the option of using a browser-based code editor, from which you can build the project inside the browser at any time. If you would prefer to use an IDE or editor you are more comfortable with, you can download the task as zip file, uploading when complete, or check the code out as a git repository.

This task will not be graded, and can be skipped if you wish, but we recommend you give it a quick try just to make sure your scored tests go as smoothly as possible!

### Problem
